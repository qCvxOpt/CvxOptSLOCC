# CvxOptSLOCC

This collection of *MATLAB* files aims to prove separability or membership in a certain SLOCC entanglement class for a given multiparticle quantum state, see `test_SEP_rhoPH.m` for an example. It is also able to perform the likelihood-ratio test, see `test_LRT_rhoPH.m` for a demonstration.

 * `test_SEP_rhoPH` Test for separability, using the 3x3 bound entangled states by P. Horodecki.
 * `test_LRT_rhoPH.m` Demonstration of the likelihood-ratio test (LRT), using the 3x3 bound entangled states by P. Horodecki.
 * `apg_Gilbert.m` The apg_Gilbert algorithm.
 * `dg_Gilbert.m` The dg_Gilbert algorithm.
 * `Gilbert_SLOCC.m` The Gilbert_SLOCC algorithm.
 * `qmt.m` Quantum measurement transform.
 * `WSLOCCMaxG.m` W-state SLOCC maximization (n-parties).
 * `RandomLocalUnitary.m` Random local unitary (uniform with respect to the Haar measure).
 * `ShuffleInit.m` Permutation of matrix generation (AB....YZ --> ZAB....Y).
